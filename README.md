# Math Platform

**Math Platform** is a AI-powered tool designed to assist mathematicians by integrating multiple theorem provers and advanced language models. Leveraging tools like Lean, Prover9, Mace4, and more in the future, MathAssistant AI facilitates seamless interaction through natural language or Lean syntax, providing comprehensive support for formal proofs, theorem exploration, and mathematical research.

## Features

- **Multi-Theorem Prover Integration:** Utilize Lean, Prover9, Mace4, and expand to additional provers effortlessly.
- **Advanced AI Admin Panel:** Powered by Farspeak, manage APIs and oversee AI operations with ease.
- **Diverse Language Models:** Harness the capabilities of Claude, OpenAI's GPT-4, and more to generate accurate and insightful mathematical assistance.
- **Flexible Communication:** Interact using natural language or Lean syntax to receive tailored help and solutions.
- **Automated Proof Generation & Verification:** Generate, verify, and refine mathematical proofs automatically across multiple platforms.
- **Future-Proof Architecture:** Designed to incorporate additional tools and models as they become available.

5. **Setup Farspeak:**
    - Follow the [Farspeak documentation](https://farspeak.example.com) to install and configure.

## Usage

### Running the tool

Run the main application:
```bash
python mathplatform.py

### Examples

1. Natural language
User: Prove that for all natural numbers n, n + 0 = n.
AI: [Generates and verifies proof using Lean, Prover9]

2. Lean
User: 
theorem add_zero (n : â„•) : n + 0 = n :=
begin
  rw nat.zero_add,
end
AI: User inputs Lean code directly. [Verifies and provides feedback or suggestions]
